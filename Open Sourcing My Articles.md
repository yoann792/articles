What is the bigest open-source project in the world? Some software on Github? No it’s the biggest Encyclopedia this Earth has ever seen: Wikipedia.

Most of you might think that only software can be open-source, but it’s a misconception. Anything can actually be open-source:

 → Elon musk open-sourced all the tesla patents in 2014 (read the blog memo here
 → Wikipedia itself is running on an open source model. Anybody can ask for content to be modified, to add content on top of      an article, to be deleted, etc.
 
Recently I’ve decided to write a bit more, especially marketing-related content. 

Something came to my mind. I’ll try to open-source my articles thanks to an experiment.

#The Experiment

**Fact:** I am not the best marketeur in the world. Nobody is. 

**Hypothesis:** If I start writing about a topic, other readers could add their knowledge to it and make it even better.

**Experiment:** I’ll put all my (most important/not personal) articles on Github. Anybody will be able to modify it and ask to merge their modifications (commits) with the Master article (the one on Medium) which will be updated just like on Github.

For those of you who don’t have Github, you’ll be able to send me an email with the changes you’re requesting. If I agree with them, I’ll create the commit myself and update the master

#What is Github

Github is a collaboration tool mainly used by developers.

It helps team stay up to date on a software project. It allows developers to work on this project without interfering with the work of others.

It helps keep the code of a software safe by working on different branches and merging them to the master only after having reviewed the modifications made by other developers, called commits. If by error, a merge creates bugs on the master branch, you can alway revert to the previous version of the Master branch. This is called versioning.
